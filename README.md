This is website design assignment from college. Is a project created for learning and demonstration purposes. 

## 📸 Photography Portfolio Website
Welcome to my Photography Portfolio Website project! This is a college-level web design assignment where I was tasked with building a visually appealing and user-friendly site to showcase a photographer’s work and allow potential clients to get in touch.

## 🌐 About the Project
As a web designer, the goal was to create an interactive and professional platform for a photographer to present their portfolio, introduce themselves, and offer a simple way for clients to request a booking. The website is built using HTML and CSS, with a focus on clear layout, accessibility, and a smooth browsing experience.

## 🔍 Key Features
Home Page – A welcoming introduction to the website with a brief tagline and a visual teaser of the photographer’s work.

Gallery Page – Organized photo collections based on categories like Portraits, Landscape, and Events. Visitors can easily browse through the photographer’s best shots.

About Page – A short biography to help visitors learn more about the photographer's background, style, and passion.

Booking Page – An interactive form where visitors can request a photoshoot, ask questions, or leave feedback. This form includes at least 5 form components (text boxes, radio buttons, textarea, submit button, etc.).

## 🧩 Website Structure
The layout is built with a clear and consistent structure on every page:

Header – Displays the site title or logo and establishes branding.

Navigation Bar – Easy-to-use menu for navigating between pages.

Content Section – The main area where each page's unique content is displayed.

Footer – Includes contact details, social media links, or copyright.

## 🎨 Styling & Design
All styling is done through external CSS, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the site. Design elements include:

Custom color palette and typography

Multi-column layout for better content organization

Hover effects and transitions to enhance interactivity

Clean, modern design that highlights photography
